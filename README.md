# blinkit_sales_analysis
Blinkit Data Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes the Blinkit dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The goal is to explore, clean, and extract insights about items, outlets, and sales trends.

⚙️ Steps in the Notebook
1. Importing & Loading Data

Imported Pandas for data manipulation.

Loaded dataset using pd.read_csv("blinkit_data.csv").

2. Data Exploration

Viewed sample rows (head, tail, sample).

Checked dataset dimensions (shape).

Explored data types & structure (dtypes, info).

Summarized numeric data (describe).

Checked for duplicates & missing values.

3. Data Understanding

Explored categorical variables like Item Fat Content.

Identified unique values and inconsistencies.

4. Data Cleaning

Standardized inconsistent category labels (e.g., "LF" → "Low Fat").

Ensured data consistency for further analysis.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed frequency counts & groupings.

Visualized distributions and comparisons using plots.

Analyzed item properties, outlet performance, and sales insights.

6. Insights

Found sales trends by item type and outlet.

Compared fat content categories.

Identified potential business strategies based on outlet performance.
